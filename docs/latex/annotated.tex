Here are the data structures with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structclient__receiver__state}{client\+\_\+receiver\+\_\+state}} }{\pageref{structclient__receiver__state}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structqsmp__keep__alive__state}{qsmp\+\_\+keep\+\_\+alive\+\_\+state}} \\*The SATP keep alive state structure. This structure tracks the state of keep alive messages within SATP. It includes the epoch time when the last keep alive message was sent, a packet sequence counter, and a flag indicating whether a response has been received }{\pageref{structqsmp__keep__alive__state}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structsatp__connection__state}{satp\+\_\+connection\+\_\+state}} \\*The SATP socket connection state structure }{\pageref{structsatp__connection__state}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structsatp__device__key}{satp\+\_\+device\+\_\+key}} \\*The SATP device key structure. This structure represents the SATP device key, which is derived from the server key. It includes the device key identity, device derivation key, and an expiration time }{\pageref{structsatp__device__key}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structsatp__kex__client__state}{satp\+\_\+kex\+\_\+client\+\_\+state}} \\*The SATP client state structure }{\pageref{structsatp__kex__client__state}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structsatp__kex__server__state}{satp\+\_\+kex\+\_\+server\+\_\+state}} \\*The SATP server state structure }{\pageref{structsatp__kex__server__state}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structsatp__master__key}{satp\+\_\+master\+\_\+key}} \\*The SATP master key structure. This structure holds the SATP master key information, including the key identity, the master derivation key, and the expiration time. The master key is used as the root from which branch keys are derived }{\pageref{structsatp__master__key}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structsatp__network__packet}{satp\+\_\+network\+\_\+packet}} \\*The SATP network packet structure. This structure defines the format of a SATP network packet. It includes a packet flag, the message length, a sequence number, a UTC timestamp for packet creation, and a pointer to the message data }{\pageref{structsatp__network__packet}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structsatp__server__key}{satp\+\_\+server\+\_\+key}} \\*The SATP server key structure. This structure represents the SATP server key, which is derived from the master key. It contains the server\textquotesingle{}s key identity, server derivation key, and expiration time }{\pageref{structsatp__server__key}}{}
