The SATP server state structure. 

This structure maintains the state of an SATP server connection during the key exchange and secure communication session. It includes the cipher states for both the receive and transmit channels, identity and session hashes, as well as the server derivation key. The structure also holds expiration information and packet sequence numbers for both receiving and transmitting messages. The {\ttfamily exflag} field indicates the current position within the key exchange process.
