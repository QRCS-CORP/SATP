/**
 * \file server.h
 * \brief SATP Server functions.
 *
 * \details
 * This header declares the functions used to implement the server component of the Symmetric Authenticated Tunneling Protocol (SATP).
 * The server functions manage client connections, broadcast messages, and control the server lifecycle through operations
 * such as pausing, resuming, and quitting. SATP employs a multi-threaded server design that supports both IPv4 and IPv6 connections.
 *
 * The functions provided in this header include:
 * - Broadcasting a message to all connected hosts.
 * - Pausing the server to suspend acceptance of new connections.
 * - Quitting the server by closing all active connections.
 * - Resuming the server listener from a paused state.
 * - Starting the multi-threaded server on IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces with support for callback functions to process
 *   incoming data and handle disconnect events.
 *
 * \note SATP_EXPORT_API is used to ensure proper symbol visibility.
